Assignment3 README
This assignment is coded and tested at lab computer gl30

In SceneNode, I changed trans matrix into 3 parts: translation, rotation and scaling. and added a field to store the transform from parent node.

In it's subclasses:
In GeometryNode, doesn't do much extra change.
In JointNode, added to double value to store angle rotation amount and a method to update rotation matrix

hierarchical transformation did in A3.cpp by mutrula recursion.

I will zip a file tho show the puppet, named as puppet.jpg

my puppet is in the Assets directory.

extra:

not only head have to ways to move, every moveable parts does the same
moveable eyebrow!

there are warnings when compile, still runable.

if there is linking problem just clean everything redo premake4 gmake. I didn't add anynew library.
